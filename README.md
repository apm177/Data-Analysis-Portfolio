| [Diamond Prices Data Analysis](https://github.com/apm177/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Project%20%231%20-%20Diamond%20Prices%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) | When judging the value of a diamond, gem experts follow the "4Cs" criteria, where they analyze 4 attributes of a diamond: Cut, Color, Clarity and Carat Weight. This project aims to see which attribute has the most influence on a diamond's worth. |✅|✅|✅|
|[Titanic Survival Data Analysis](https://github.com/apm177/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Project%20%232%20-%20Titanic%20Survival%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)|The most infamous shipwreck in human history is undoubtedly the sinking of the Titanic.
